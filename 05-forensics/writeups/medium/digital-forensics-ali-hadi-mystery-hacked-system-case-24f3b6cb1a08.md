# Digital Forensics🔍-[Ali Hadi — Mystery Hacked System Case]

Hey CyberDefenders, I surely we can learn a lot from Ali Hadi’s case, so bear with me to the end!

Scenario : One day an IT dept. guy/gal came to work to find the message below written in a file on his/her system! He/Her immediately reported that to you. Now you must:

- How did the threat actor get into the system? (What is your hypothesis)

- What evidence did you find that proves your hypothesis?

- How did you approach and solve the case? (write a report)

- Anything you would like to add?

>

*Let’s do Digital Forensics Investigation!*Hypothesis —

- (Initial Access) Was it through the user’s browser, binary exploitation or remote service installation?

- (Execution & Persistence) Is there any suspicious parent-children process activity, temporary folder, scheduled task or Run/RunOnce key creation?

- (C2 connection) Is there any outbound connection made, and by which process if so?

- (Data Exfiltration) Any sensitive data is exfiltrated?

Evidence tells the truth —

Checking MP Support Logs artifacts (*ProgramData/Microsoft/Windows Defender/Support*), looks like there’s no malicious file being detected and picked up by Windows Defender.
