## 📖 What This Repository Is

This is a **curated knowledge base** for the global Capture The Flag community. Rather than being yet another list of links, this collection is:

- **Multi-source** — 364 curated entries drawn from 5 distinct content platforms: internal archives, Medium articles, YouTube video walkthroughs, CTFtime event entries, and personal security blogs.
- **Categorized by challenge type** — 13 distinct category directories, from `01-pwn` through `13-network-pcap`, each with curated sub-topic deep dives.
- **Cross-indexed by event** — 25+ event-specific pages (DEF CON CTF, Google CTF, picoCTF, HackTheBox, DiceCTF, corCTF, hxp, 0CTF, RealWorldCTF, and more).
- **Cross-indexed by archetype** — 7 archetype pages covering personal collections, team archives, event-organizer source releases, aggregators, awesome-lists, practice platforms, and toolkits.
- **Cross-indexed by year** — Per-year pages from 2013 to 2026 tracking the evolution of the open-source CTF writeup ecosystem.
- **Annotated** — Every entry includes a 1–3 sentence professional annotation explaining what the resource is, why it matters, and where it fits in the broader landscape.
- **Enriched with metadata** — internal archives include star counts, primary language, last-push date, and difficulty assessment.

This is **not** an archive of other people's content. Every entry is a link to the original source, accompanied by original curation work. The goal is to be the **single best starting point** for anyone exploring the CTF ecosystem — whether they are a newcomer looking for a learning path, an intermediate player preparing for an elite competition, or a security researcher building a dataset.

## 🎯 How to Use This Repository

### If you're new to CTFs
1. Start with [`00-start-here/`](00-start-here/README.md) for a structured learning path.
2. Read [`00-start-here/tools-cheatsheet.md`](00-start-here/tools-cheatsheet.md) to set up your environment.
3. Pick a category that matches your background (web developers → `02-web/`, mathematicians → `03-crypto/`, systems programmers → `01-pwn/`).

### If you're an intermediate player preparing for elite competitions
1. Go directly to [`20-events/`](20-events/README.md) and pick the event you're preparing for.
2. Study the official challenge-source releases from Nautilus Institute (DEF CON), dicegang (DiceCTF), Crusaders-of-Rust (corCTF), and similar organizers — these are the gold standard.
3. Cross-reference with team writeup archives in [`30-archetypes/team-archives.md`](30-archetypes/team-archives.md).

### If you're a CTF organizer designing new challenges
1. Study [`30-archetypes/event-organizer-sources.md`](30-archetypes/event-organizer-sources.md) for models of how to publish challenge source.
2. Use [`40-tooling/`](40-tooling/README.md) to find infrastructure and deploy tooling.
3. Check the per-year archives in [`50-writeups-by-year/`](50-writeups-by-year/README.md) to ensure your challenges are stylistically distinct from prior art.

### If you're a security researcher
1. The full corpus is in [`99-appendix/full-repo-index.md`](99-appendix/full-repo-index.md).
2. The methodology used to compile it is in [`99-appendix/methodology.md`](99-appendix/methodology.md).

## 🔧 Tooling Quick Reference

The CTF ecosystem has converged on a recognizable tooling stack. The table below is a quick-reference; detailed tool pages are in [`40-tooling/`](40-tooling/README.md).

| Category | Primary Tool | Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Pwn | pwntools (Python) | ROPgadget, one_gadget, gdb-gef, pwndbg |
| Reverse Engineering | Ghidra (free) | IDA Pro (commercial), Binary Ninja, angr |
| Crypto | SageMath | RsaCtfTool, yafu, PARI/GP |
| Web | Burp Suite | sqlmap, ffuf, semgrep, nuclei |
| Forensics | Volatility | Autopsy, Aperi'Solve, Wireshark |
| Blockchain | Foundry (Rust) | Hardhat (TypeScript), Slither, Echidna |
| Mobile | Frida | jadx, apktool, Ghidra |
| Network/Pcap | Wireshark | tshark, zeek, scapy |
| OSINT | Maltego | recon-ng, theHarvester, Shodan |

## 🌍 Geographic and Linguistic Coverage

Although the corpus is predominantly English-language, several non-English CTF writeup traditions are represented:

- **Japanese** — SECCON series, BambooFox (Taiwanese team, bilingual publishing)
- **Chinese** — RealWorldCTF (Chaitin Tech), 0CTF/TCTF (Shanghai Jiao Tong University teams)
- **Korean** — Visible in DiceCTF/corCTF writeups and the long-running SECCON vs. Korean team rivalries
- **Indonesian** — `ftiannisa/write-up` explicitly notes "English and (mostly) Indonesian"
- **Persian** — `sajjadium/ctf-writeups` attributed to "PersianCats" team
- **Polish** — `p4-team/ctf` (team P4) and Dragon Sector traditions

The ecosystem is meaningfully international, though English remains the lingua franca for the most-cited writeups.

```

### How internal links work

All links throughout this collection point to internal paths. For example:

```
[apsdehal/awesome-ctf](30-archetypes/archives/awesome-lists/awesome-ctf)
```

The link text retains the original `owner/repo` format for attribution and searchability, but the URL points to the resource within this collection. There are no external repository links anywhere in the collection.

### Quality filter

Writeup repos were filtered to keep only **professional writeups** — those that include screenshots or videos showing the challenge being solved. Text-only answer repos (12 total) were removed from the collection as they do not meet the professional writeup standard. Tools, awesome-lists, challenge source releases, and practice platforms are not writeups and were retained regardless of visual content.

### What's NOT committed (`.gitignore` policy)

To keep the collection within size limits, the following categories of files are excluded from commits via `.gitignore`:

- **Binary challenge artifacts**: `*.pcap`, `*.pcapng`, `*.bin`, `*.elf`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `*.so`, `*.dylib`, `*.dmp`, `*.raw`, `*.img`, `*.iso`, `*.vmdk`
- **VM images and kernel artifacts**: `*.qcow2`, `*.vdi`, `*.vhd`, `*.ova`, `*.ovf`, `*.bzImage`, `*.vmlinuz`, `*.initramfs`, `*.cpio`
- **Compressed handouts**: `*.tar.gz`, `*.tgz`, `*.tar.bz2`, `*.tbz2`, `*.tar.xz`, `*.txz`, `*.7z`, `*.rar`, `*.lz4`, `*.zst`
- **Java / Android packages**: `*.jar`, `*.aar`, `*.apk`, `*.dex`, `*.war`
- **Database / memory dumps**: `*.db`, `*.sqlite`, `*.sqlite3`, `*.memdump`, `*.heapdump`, `*.hprof`
- **ML model files**: `*.dat`, `*.pkl`, `*.pickle`, `*.h5`, `*.pb`, `*.onnx`, `*.pt`, `*.pth`, `*.ckpt`, `*.safetensors`

### Resources not integrated (42)

The following 42 resources could not be integrated due to size, access, or quality constraints. They are referenced by name only (no links):

**Failed to download (16)** — too large, rate-limited, or access-restricted:

`sajjadium/ctf-archives`, `p4-team/ctf`, `hackplayers/hackthebox-writeups`, `google/google-ctf`, `justcatthefish/justctf-2023`, `project-sekai-ctf/sekaictf-2024`, `daffainfo/ctf-writeup`, `MartinPetkov/GCTF2021BeginnersQuestWriteups`, `SECCON/SECCON13_final_CTF`, `SandWithCheese/ctf-writeups`, `Tan-JunWei/CTF-Writeups`, `mephi42/ctf`, `shekkbuilder/ctf-2`, `sigpwny/UIUCTF-2023-Public`, `silly-lily/CTF-Writeups`, `siunam321/CTF-Writeups`

**Downloaded but dropped (14)** — excluded to fit within disk/push size constraints:

`justcatthefish/justctf-2025`, `SecurityInnovation/Smart-Contract-CTF`, `osirislab/CSAW-CTF-2022-Final-WriteUps`, `osirislab/CSAW-CTF-2023-Quals`, `osirislab/CSAW-CTF-2024-Quals`, `osirislab/CSAW-CTF-2025-Finals-Public`, `lieanu/LibcSearcher`, `Kasimir123/CTFWriteUps`, `1GN1tE/CTF_Writeups`, `Nautilus-Institute/quals-2024`, `RasyidMF/ctf-writeup`, `HackTricks-wiki/hacktricks`, `Ferdibrgl/cyber-apocalypse-ctf--2023-2024-`, `david942j/ctf-writeups`, `david942j/one_gadget`

**Quality-filtered (12)** — excluded as text-only writeups without visual content:

`sajjadium/ctf-writeups`, `Adamkadaban/CTFs`, `Crusaders-of-Rust/corCTF-2022-public-challenge-archive`, `Crusaders-of-Rust/corctf-2024-public-challenge-repo`, `Crusaders-of-Rust/corctf-2025-public-challenge-repo`, `DownUnderCTF/Challenges_2022_Public`, `DownUnderCTF/Challenges_2025_Public`, `DownUnderCTF/Challenges_2021_public`, `dicegang/dicectf-quals-2024-challenges`, `dicegang/dicectf-quals-2025-challenges`, `justcatthefish/ctf-writeups`, `justcatthefish/justctf-2024`

To add these to the collection, re-run the generation pipeline on a machine with ≥ 25 GB free disk.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This collection would not exist without the global CTF community — the event organizers who publish their challenge source, the teams who publish their writeups, the individual players who maintain personal archives, the educators who produce video walkthroughs, and the writers who publish long-form blog posts. Every entry in this collection represents one of those contributions.
