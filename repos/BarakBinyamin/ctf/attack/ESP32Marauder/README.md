# ESP32 Marauder
A cool wifi hacking tool that this project will use to deauth

# The story of getting this to work on mac
Attempts to compile and load on regular esp32 dev board
### Add the build and compler flags to ur platform.txt
do this for esp32s2 too and any other chips you might be compiling for
1. mv User_setup.h .pio/build/libdeps/TFT_eSPI
2. Go into ~/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoespressif32/platform.txt
3. cmd+f for build.extra_flags.esp32, replace `=...` with `=-w`
4. cmd+f for compiler.c.elf.libs.esp32, replace `=...` with `=-w-zmuldefs`
5. ohhhh, the docs say you need espressif32 @ 2.0.1
### Sad, espressif32 @ 2.0.1 looks lke its not supported on darwin_x86_64
```
Resolving esp32doit-devkit-v1 dependencies...
Platform Manager: Installing espressif32 @ 2.0.1
UnknownPackageError: Could not find the package with 'espressif32 @ 2.0.1' requirements for your system 'darwin_x86_64'
```
### Trying platformio with docker on mac to avoid the darwin_x86_64 error
First Run docker desktop, then
```
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/workspace -u `id -u $USER`:`id -g $USER` --privileged  sglahn/platformio-core:latest ;bash
sudo pip install -U platformio
platformio run
# Results in

Platform Manager: Installing espressif32 @ 2.0.1
UnknownPackageError: Could not find the package with 'espressif32 @ 2.0.1' requirements for your system 'darwin_x86_64'
```

### Maybe just try arduino?
1. Go to ls "/Users/`whoami`/Library/Arduino15"
2. Do a bunch of stuff that breaks your arduino ide dependencies
3. Then find on reddit that there's already a binary for it premade for the devkit [https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/zgxkjd/questionesp32_for_marauder/](https://www.reddit.com/r/flipperzero/comments/zgxkjd/questionesp32_for_marauder/) What? The OTA upload tool was for normal dev boards too! reddit says... yup

This has been emotional
